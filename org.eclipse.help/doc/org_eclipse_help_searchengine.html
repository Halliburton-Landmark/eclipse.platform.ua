Search Engine</h1></center>
<b><i>Identifier: </i></b>org.eclipse.help.searchEngine
<p><b><i>Description:</i></b> For defining the search engine to be used
with the help system UI implementation.
<br>This extension point is an internal extension point utilized only by
the current implementation of the Eclipse Help System, and is not intended
to be used outside that scope. It defines the search engine that will be
used when online documentation is being searched. If a plugin in a given
Eclipse installation contributes to this extension point, the Help System
will automatically display an additional "search" view to each information
set displayed. This search view uses the contributed search engine as it's
underlying search mechanism.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Configuration Markup: </b>for internal use only.</i>
<p><b><i>API Information</i>: </b><i>for internal use only.</i>
<p><b><i>Supplied Implementation: </i></b>The current implementation of
the help system UI supplied with the Eclipse platform fully supports this
extension point. An implementation of this extension point will be provided
as a separate, optional, plug-in (<tt>com.ibm.help.search</tt>) that can
be installed on top of the base Eclipse platform.
